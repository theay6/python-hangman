# 🌍 Hangman: Countries Edition  

A simple console-based **Hangman** game where the secret words are **countries from around the world**.  

Built in pure Python, no extra libraries. Just you, your terminal, and vibes.

## 🎮 How to Play  

- Run the script → the computer picks a random country.  
- You’ll see blanks like `_ _ _ _ _`.  
- Guess **one letter** at a time, or try the **whole country name**.  
- Each wrong guess draws a little more of the hangman. You only get **6 lives**.  
- Solve the word before the stick figure gets fully drawn.
